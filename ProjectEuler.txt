0001    If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or
        5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the
        sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

0002    Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the
        previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2 the first 10 terms will
        be:

        1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89

        By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not
        exceed 4 million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
